* Use RST docstrings in Python
* Pin Python dependencies to a major version. Use ~= syntax. I.e. `requests ~= 2.31` instead of `requests>=2.31.0,<3.0.0`
* Use Makefile-example as a Makefile example.
* When a variable or output description is too long, use HEREDOC construction to wrap lines.
* The module should only require providers it actually uses to create direct resources. Child modules should take care
  of their required providers.
* When including other Terraform modules, always pin them to exact version.
* For IAM policies, use data source policy document, don't use a generated json.

## Tagging
* use lowercase tags except Name
* use created_by_module
* Create one selected "main" resource with module_version tag
* Use environment tags and require it from a user

## InfraHouse Terraform testing
* The root module must define variables in terraform.tfvars
